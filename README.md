# Footsite-Bot 

###ideas from jw6602


1. Extract profiles and tasks information from CSV file.
2. Third party captcha API.
3. Management Tasks. 
4. Simple Log ( May change it later with whole log system) 
5. Updated Footsite module and proxy parse


It contains the captcha solver, but for the anticaptcha, I just import it and do not use it.

For the captcha solver after adding to cart, I keep my method in this project. To use it, 

all you need to do is an API address or you can change this method.



1. To run the bot, make sure you put the proxy firstly.

2. The initial information for setting data in the data file, you can simply fllow the form.

3. That is all you need.
